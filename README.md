# MicroLobby - 3rd gen lobbyserver for Warzone 2100

MicroLobby is the next, next gen lobbyserver for Warzone 2100 after [wzlobbserver-ng](https://github.com/Warzone2100/wzlobbyserver-ng).

## Basic Architecture

It's written in Golang by using [go-micro.dev/v4](https://go-micro.dev) for simplicity. Transport, Registry and Broker is done over NATS.

The draw.io flowchart for the Architecture:

## Services

### http_proxy

A very simple Proxy to MicroServices. They have to register routes with it:

- Auth Service
- Lobby Service
- Settings Service

### Settings Service

Basic Key/Value Store with Permissions

### Auth Service

- Give Username + password and you get a JWT back.
- Internaly converts a JWT to a user with roles.

### Lobby Service

Register a game, get list of games and unregister it.

### EMail Service

Sends E-Mails for us.

### OAuth Service

Think it will never be implemented but be part of Profile Service which will be added later.

## Development
