# MicroLobby - 3rd gen lobbyserver for Warzone 2100

MicroLobby is the next, next gen lobbyserver for Warzone 2100 after [wzlobbserver-ng](https://github.com/Warzone2100/wzlobbyserver-ng).

## Features

- Requires only:
  - Podman/Docker
  - docker-compose
  - task
- Everything in containers, leaves nothing on the Host except Podman/Docker volumes. "task rm" removes everything.
- Automated migrations, migrating on start
- gRPC+Protobuf internal, JSON/XML external
- Argon2-id Hashes
- JWT Tokens
- Integrated RBAC K/V store -> settings/v1
- Loosely coupled Microservices
- Fast to copy&paste a service, easy to start a new one
- Event System as example for IRC/Discord bots
- All communication over NATS. It scales!
- Scale your db and everything else scales easy as it needs no Filesystem

## Basic Architecture

It's written in Golang by using [go-micro.dev/v4](https://go-micro.dev) for simplicity. Registry and Broker is done over NATS, Transport over gRPC.

## Services

### http_proxy

A very simple Proxy to MicroServices. They have to register routes with it over the help of infoservice.

It provides 3 routes, the result will be collected from all microservices:

| METHOD | Route             | AUTH | Description           |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---- | --------------------- |
| GET    | /health           |  n   | Summary health        |
| GET    | /proxy/v1/health  |  y   | Detailed health       |
| GET    | /proxy/v1/routes  |  y   | List of all routes    |

### settings/v1 Service

Basic Key/Value Store with Permissions

### auth/v1 Service

- Give Username + password and you get a JWT back.
- Internaly converts a JWT to a user with roles.

### lobby/v1 Service

Register a game, get list of games and unregister it.

## Development

### Prerequesits

- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation)

```

- Check the proxy health api

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/proxy/v1/health | jq
```
