## Basic Architecture

It's written in Golang by using [go-micro.dev/v4](https://go-micro.dev) for simplicity. Registry and Broker is done over NATS, Transport over gRPC.

The draw.io flowchart for the Architecture:

## Services

### http_proxy

A very simple Proxy to MicroServices. They have to register routes with it over the help of infoservice.

It provides 3 routes, the result will be collected from all microservices:

| METHOD | Route             | AUTH | Description           |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---- | --------------------- |
| GET    | /health           |  n   | Summary health        |
| GET    | /proxy/v1/health  |  y   | Detailed health       |
| GET    | /proxy/v1/routes  |  y   | List of all routes    |

### settings/v1 Service

Basic Key/Value Store with Permissions

### auth/v1 Service

- Give Username + password and you get a JWT back.
- Internaly converts a JWT to a user with roles.

### lobby/v1 Service

### OAuth Service

Think it will never be implemented but be part of Profile Service which will be added later.
